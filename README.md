# RaylibBasic

Very basic raylib starting ground.
(Modified from [here](https://github.com/raylib-extras/game-premake/))

Just change the folder "GAME_NAME" to your desired name and click "premake-VisualStudio.bat".
If raylib isn't already installed, it will clone the most recent git version.

And you are already done. Have fun!
